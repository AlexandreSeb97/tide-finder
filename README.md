# tide-finder
This tool finds the tide schedule* of a site using the LAT/LON and timestamp from a satellite observation, helping tie observations to the tidal profile for better analysis of coastal/wetland environments.

The tide schedule will be found from closest public records and the TPXO model.

*for complex topographies (like inland/embayment areas with shallow water) it is recommended to use inverse solutions as these would fit the data better. 

This tool is being developed by the Dr. Mark T. Stacey PhD students at UC Berkeley:
- Alexandre Georges
- Lily Engel
- Lukas WinklerPrins
- Matthew Falcone
